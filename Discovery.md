## 2.a Gap Analysis Summary (Lessons 1.1–8.3)

This section compares the implemented lesson files under `apps/web/src/pages/instructions/modules/module-*/lessons/` with the lesson IDs and titles defined in each `ModuleXPage.tsx`.

* **Coverage by module**
  * Module 1: `1.1`–`1.8` present (`module-1/lessons/1.1.tsx` … `1.8.tsx`).
  * Module 2: `2.1`–`2.3` present.
  * Module 3: `3.1`–`3.3` present.
  * Module 4: `4.1`–`4.6` present.
  * Module 5: `5.1`–`5.3` present.
  * Module 6: `6.1`–`6.3` present.
  * Module 7: `7.1`–`7.3` present.
  * Module 8: `8.1`–`8.3` present.

* **Missing or extra lessons**
  * None. Every lesson ID referenced in:
    * `module-1/Module1Page.tsx` through `module-8/Module8Page.tsx`
    * has a corresponding `X.Y.tsx` file in the `lessons/` directory.

* **Title alignment**
  * `Discovery.md` and `COURSE_OUTLINE.md` have been updated to match the titles defined in each `ModuleXPage.tsx`.

* **UI label discrepancy (minor)**
  * In `module-4/Module4Page.tsx`, the footer "next" link (when no next lesson remains) displays label: "Multi-Turn Conversation" (singular, capital T) linking to `/instructions/module-5/5.1`.
  * `module-5/Module5Page.tsx` defines lesson `5.1` title as: "Multi-turn Conversations" (hyphen lower-case t, plural).
  * Recommendation: standardize the label in `Module4Page.tsx` to "Multi-turn Conversations" for consistency.

No further discrepancies were found.

### Module 1.1 – Quality Review

### 1. Overall Assessment
- Scores:
  - Content Appropriateness: 5/5  
  - Logical Flow: 5/5  
  - Progressive Learning: 5/5  
  - Engagement & Reinforcement: 4/5  
  - Clarity & Accessibility: 5/5  
- Narrative Summary: The lesson accurately frames LLMs as next-token predictors and grounds concepts with approachable metaphors ("autocomplete on steroids"). It progresses smoothly from the core idea to tokenization, decoding, and prompt shaping, with clear scaffolding (glossary, myths vs. reality, quick checks). Engagement is strong via mini-exercises and an inline chat, though reinforcement could be deepened with more targeted feedback loops.

### 2. Quality Analysis
- Scores:  
  - Accuracy & Depth: 5/5  
  - Consistency: 5/5  
  - Interactivity: 4/5  
  - Assessment Alignment: 4/5  
  - Learning Objectives Fit: 5/5  
- Strengths:  
  1. Clear, correct explanations of tokens, probability distributions, and decoding with concrete examples.  
  2. Consistent structure and terminology, aided by `LessonTemplate`, `KeyTakeaways`, and coherent UI components.  
  3. Practical prompts and pop quizzes promote immediate application; `InlineChat` lowers friction to practice.  
- Weaknesses:  
  1. Quizzes rely on self-check or single-answer explanations; limited feedback for incorrect choices.  
  2. Interactivity is primarily reflective; few graded or progress-tracking checkpoints.  
  3. No explicit accessibility callouts for reduced-motion or screen reader cues within the lesson body.

### 3. Educational Improvement Opportunities
1. Assessment Design: Enhance `quizQuestions` to include explanations for all options (correct and incorrect) to strengthen misconception repair.  
2. Instructional Design: Add a lightweight “Validated!” check for the structured prompt exercise (e.g., detect presence of Task/Constraints/Output) to provide immediate formative feedback.  
3. Engagement & Accessibility: Include aria-live hints for the InlineChat response area and add a note respecting reduced motion (align with course-wide a11y goals).  
4. Content Enhancement: Add one real-world micro-case (e.g., budgeting assistant) that shows how prompt structure alters output quality and latency trade-offs (greedy vs sampling).  
5. Assessment Alignment: Convert the “Quick Check” into a short, auto-graded checklist or require a rubric-based self-assessment recorded in local state.

- Weaknesses:
  1. Quick Checks rely on self‑assessment via chat; minimal built-in validation.
  2. No explicit aria-live for dynamic demo outputs.
  3. Explanations in `quizQuestions` do not address every incorrect option.

### 3. Educational Improvement Opportunities
1. Assessment: Add per-option rationales to `quizQuestions` and a lightweight auto-check for Quick Checks (e.g., detect “greedy vs sampling” mention, token budget reasoning).
2. Accessibility: Add aria-live to interactive result regions in `InteractiveTokenizer` and `PredictTheNextToken`.

- Limited ops guidance (monitoring, incident response) in security module.

### 4) Top Improvement Recommendations (MoSCoW + Effort)
- MUST: Add `aria-live` regions, focus management, and reduced‑motion respect to interactive components. (Low–Med)
- MUST: Add export/persistence for key artifacts (schemas, prompts, JSONL, experiment logs). (Low–Med)
- SHOULD: Add brief ops panel for monitoring, canaries, incident response. (Low)
- SHOULD: Include fairness metric trade‑offs and XAI caveats panels. (Low)
- COULD: Add shareable screenshots/“Export to portfolio” across lessons. (Low)
- COULD: Provide sample artifacts library (good/bad examples). (Med)

### 5) Acceptance Criteria Alignment (course‑level)
- AI assistance present and effective across modules. 
- Ratio/metrics accuracy where applicable; assessment fidelity high. 
- Persistence: partially met (needs export features). 
- Accessibility: strong intent; needs explicit implementation checks. 
- Performance: guidance present (streaming, model tiers); acceptable. 

### 6) Next Actions
- Create an Accessibility Implementer’s Checklist (global) and link into each lesson’s interactive.
- Add a lightweight `usePortfolioArtifacts` store (Zustand) with JSON/CSV export helpers.
- Update lesson components to surface Export/Save actions; add unit tests for exporters.
- Add a short “Ops & Monitoring” blurb to Module 8.3.
