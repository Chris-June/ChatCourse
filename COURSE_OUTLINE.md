# Course: Building with AI - A New Way to Create

## Welcome to the Future of Building!

This course is all about a new way of creating things with technology. We're not going to focus on writing complex code line-by-line. Instead, we'll learn how to have conversations with powerful AI models to bring our ideas to life. Think of it as being the director of a movie, and the AI is your talented crew, ready to follow your lead.

**Who is this for?**

This is for anyone who has an idea and wants to build it, but doesn't want to get bogged down in traditional coding. It's for creative thinkers, problem solvers, and the curious at heart.

**Our Project**

We'll be working on this very project you see here! It's a living example of what's possible with AI. The best part? You'll get to contribute your ideas, and we'll build them together, using AI as our primary tool.
