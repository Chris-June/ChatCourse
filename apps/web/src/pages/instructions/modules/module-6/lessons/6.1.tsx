          Every great AI product starts not with a model, but with a problem.
          This lesson introduces a structured framework for turning a raw idea
          into a viable product blueprint. We'll cover how to define the
          user's need, assess feasibility, prioritize effectively, and test
          your concept before writing a single line of AI code.

                  A startup wanted to build an AI that summarizes meeting
                  notes. Instead of building a complex model, they had an
                  intern listen to meeting recordings and manually write
                  summaries. They used this to test different summary formats
                  and see if users actually found the service valuable. The
                  feedback they gathered was crucial for building the real
                  product.
