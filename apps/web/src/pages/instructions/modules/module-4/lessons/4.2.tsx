      correctAnswer: 'It allows the AI to request multiple actions at once, reducing latency.',

      correctAnswer: 'An array of JSON objects, where each object represents a function to be called.',

          Simple tasks might need one tool, but complex queries often require a coordinated effort. Imagine asking an assistant to book a flight and reserve a rental car. This requires two different tools. Modern AI can handle this by calling multiple functions in a single turn, making workflows much more powerful and efficient.

            Think of it like cooking. If you need to chop vegetables before you can sauté them, that's a <strong>sequential</strong> process. If you can preheat the oven while you chop vegetables, that's a <strong>parallel</strong> process. The AI decides which approach to use based on the user's request and the tools available.
