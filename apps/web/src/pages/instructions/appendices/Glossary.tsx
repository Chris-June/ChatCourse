  { term: 'Agent', definition: 'An autonomous entity that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve goals. Often used in multi-agent AI systems.' },
  { term: 'Agentic Workflow', definition: 'A design pattern where multiple agents (AI models or subprocesses) collaborate, often asynchronously, to complete a task or workflow.' },
  { term: 'Algorithm', definition: 'A set of rules or instructions given to an AI, computer, or other problem-solving machine to help it learn and make decisions on its own.' },
  { term: 'Artificial Intelligence (AI)', definition: 'The simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.' },
  { term: 'Chatbot', definition: 'A computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet.' },
  { term: 'Context Window', definition: 'The maximum amount of tokens (input and output combined) an LLM can handle at once. Larger windows allow for longer documents or conversations.' },
  { term: 'Dataset', definition: 'A collection of data. In machine learning, datasets are used to train models.' },
  { term: 'Deep Learning', definition: 'A subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.' },
  { term: 'Embedding', definition: 'A numerical vector representation of data (such as text) used for similarity search, semantic clustering, and retrieval.' },
  { term: 'Environment Variable', definition: 'A variable whose value is set outside the program, typically in the operating system. Used to store sensitive information like API keys.' },
  { term: 'Function Calling', definition: 'A feature in LLM APIs that lets the model invoke structured functions or tools by returning JSON-like responses.' },
  { term: 'Generative AI', definition: 'A type of AI that can create new content, such as text, images, music, and code.' },
  { term: 'Hallucination', definition: 'A phenomenon where an AI model generates false or nonsensical information that is presented as fact.' },
  { term: 'Large Language Model (LLM)', definition: 'A type of AI model designed to understand and generate human-like text. Trained on vast amounts of text data.' },
  { term: 'Machine Learning (ML)', definition: 'A field of AI that enables a system to learn from data rather than through explicit programming.' },
  { term: 'MCP (Model Context Protocol)', definition: 'A modular system protocol for defining how context, memory, and tasks are passed between AI agents and tools to coordinate workflows.' },
  { term: 'Model', definition: 'In AI, a model is the output of a machine learning algorithm run on data. It represents the rules, numbers, and other data structures that the system has learned.' },
  { term: 'Natural Language Processing (NLP)', definition: 'A branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language.' },
  { term: 'Neural Network', definition: 'A series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.' },
  { term: 'Prompt', definition: 'The input, typically text, given to an AI model to generate a response.' },
  { term: 'Prompt Engineering', definition: 'The craft of designing inputs (prompts) to optimize how AI models respond. Includes techniques like few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought.' },
  { term: 'RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)', definition: 'A hybrid method that combines LLM generation with real-time search or database retrieval for accurate and up-to-date responses.' },
  { term: 'System Prompt', definition: 'A special prompt used to set the behavior or personality of the AI model before user input is received.' },
  { term: 'Token', definition: 'The basic unit of text that a language model processes. A token can be a word, part of a word, or punctuation.' },
  { term: 'Tool Use / Toolformer', definition: 'The ability of an AI to call external tools or APIs (e.g., calculator, web search) during reasoning.' },
  { term: 'Vector Database', definition: 'A specialized database that stores and indexes embedding vectors to enable fast similarity searches (e.g., pgvector, Pinecone).' },
